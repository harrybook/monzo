## Configuration

A few steps are required before the application is ready to run.

Firstly, create an application in [Monzo's developer dashboard](https://developers.monzo.com/) (this is required whilst Monzo is still in beta). Use `http://localhost:2020/callback` as the redirect URL, and set the confidentiality to "confidential". Note down the client ID and client secret.

Secondly, if you want support for Google Maps integration, [get an API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and note this down too.

Lastly, duplicate `config.sample.js` and rename to `config.js`. Update this file with your keys.
